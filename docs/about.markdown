Originally trained in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Tulane University and New York Medical College, I spent the early part of my career investigating drivers of infectious disease transmission.  Since then, I have transitioned to the advertising industry and develop tools to quantify the effectiveness of marketing efforts.

I like to incorporate Bayesian methods into my causal workflows.  Through my writings I hope to empower others to explore these methods and discover the exciting world of probabilistic programming!
